How I will plan to manage the team
- as a leader, i am there to provide direction and let them explore, reporting back to me occasionally to check if they are on the right path, not to tell people what to do

- weekly casual meetings
	- ensure to ask the individual at least once a week about how their project is going
		- check for issues that they are having
		- check if they need more direction on the project
		- check if they need more things to work on
		- give advice/help with problems
- aim to be as present as possible
