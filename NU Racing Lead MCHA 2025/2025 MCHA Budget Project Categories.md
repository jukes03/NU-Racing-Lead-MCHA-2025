### Splurge
- Keyed AT connectors where necessary (CEN, DEN)
- EXPANSION BOARD
	- fixes to CAN lines and GND plane
	- Shock pots
	- wheel speed sensors
	- steering angle sensor
- PEN
	- caps to brake sensor inputs
	- resize to pedal box
- SWEN 
	- dials for torque, regen, and others?
- DEN
	- change to chassis
	- all naming of AMS to BMS
- CEN
	- route BMS and IMD to HIP
	- change to opposite side of HIP
	- spec fuses properly
	- interpose from LVD to CEN
	- another double MOSFET circuit 
	- temperature sensing circuit for radiator fan, reduce amount of time fan is on
- BSPD 
	- remove resistor voltage divider, add in pot
- HFR (2x)
	- add back in op amps, with researched protection circuit on input
- UEN
	-  Mount Ready to Move light (amber light)
		- example: https://www.amazon.com.au/LED-Trailer-Marker-Surface-Waterproof/dp/B08FXWXJZR?gQT=2&th=1
	- loom changes
- HIP 
	- MSD
	- Ready to Move and TSSI
	- HV connector interlock 
- TSAL_DISCHARGE
	- Ready to Move and TSSI
- LVD
	- move to top plate 
		- looms to connect LVD to Lid
- AIL
	- have it be part of LVD, spend time to ensure that it is functional
	- also have volt meter as a spare
- Accumulator development
- Motors
	- Spare 228 (i think there might be already one there)
- Motor Controller
	- retrieve the one being repaired
	- order a spare in case (DX version)
