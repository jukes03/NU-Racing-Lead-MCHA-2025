### Splurge
- Keyed AT connectors where necessary (CEN, DEN)
- EXPANSION BOARD
	- fixes to CAN lines and GND plane
	- Shock pots
	- wheel speed sensors
	- steering angle sensor
	- SWEN functionality
	- temp sensors for radiator 
		- temp sensors are already in the radiator 
		- DBC file update
		- MoTeC
- PEN
	- caps to brake sensor inputs
	- resize to pedal box
	- keyed connector for DEN connector
- SWEN 
	- dials for torque, regen, and others?
- DEN
	- change to chassis
	- all naming of AMS to BMS
	- keyed connectors for CEN and PEN connectors
- CEN
	- route BMS and IMD to HIP
		- change 12 pin CEN DT to 18 pin AT
			- to accommodate for IMD, BMS, and AMBER_SWITCHED_GND
	- change to opposite side of HIP
	- spec fuses properly
	- interpose from LVD to CEN
	- another double MOSFET circuit 
	- temperature sensing circuit for radiator fan, reduce amount of time fan is on
- BSPD 
	- remove resistor voltage divider, add in pot
- HFR (2x)
	- add back in op amps, with researched protection circuit on input
- UEN
	-  Mount Ready to Move light (amber light)
		- example: https://www.amazon.com.au/LED-Trailer-Marker-Surface-Waterproof/dp/B08FXWXJZR?gQT=2&th=1
	- loom changes
- HIP 
	- MSD
	- Ready to Move and TSSI
		- change 12 pin CEN DT to 18 pin AT
			- to accommodate for IMD, BMS, and AMBER_SWITCHED_GND
	- HV connector interlock 
- TSAL_DISCHARGE
	- Ready to Move and TSSI
- LVD
	- move to top plate 
		- looms to connect LVD to Lid
	- use this connector for the big 22 pin molex connector
		- https://www.te.com/en/product-6437288-6.html
- AIL
	- have it be part of LVD, spend time to ensure that it is functional
	- also have volt meter as a spare
- Accumulator development
- Motors
	- Spare 228 (i think there might be already one there)
- Motor Controller
	- retrieve the one being repaired
	- order a spare in case (DX version)
