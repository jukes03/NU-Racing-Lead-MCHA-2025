- PEN
	- caps to brake sensor inputs
	- resize to pedal box
	- keyed connector for DEN connector
- SWEN 
	- dials for torque, regen, and others?

	- all naming of AMS to BMS
	- keyed connectors for CEN and PEN connectors
- CEN Mobo
	- route BMS and IMD to HIP
		- change 12 pin CEN DT to 18 pin AT
			- to accommodate for IMD, BMS, and AMBER_SWITCHED_GND
	- change to opposite side of HIP
	- spec fuses properly
	- interpose from LVD to CEN
	- another double MOSFET circuit 
	- temperature sensing circuit for radiator fan, reduce amount of time fan is on
	- TSAL DT:
		- change naming from TSAL to UEN
		- make it an 8 pin connector
			- to route new red switched ground
- BSPD 
	- remove resistor voltage divider, add in pot
- HFR (2x)
	- add back in op amps, with researched protection circuit on input
- UEN
	-  Mount Ready to Move light (amber light)
		- example: https://www.amazon.com.au/LED-Trailer-Marker-Surface-Waterproof/dp/B08FXWXJZR?gQT=2&th=1
	- loom changes
- HIP 
	- change all naming of HVD to MSD on schematic and enclosure
	- Ready to Move and TSSI
		- change 12 pin CEN DT to 18 pin AT
			- to accommodate for IMD, BMS, and AMBER_SWITCHED_GND
	- HV connector interlock 
	- change HIP to DCDC connector, one that is rated to pack voltage
- TSAL_DISCHARGE
	- Ready to Move and TSSI
- LVD
	- move to top plate 
		- looms to connect LVD to Lid
	- use this connector for the big 22 pin molex connector
		- https://www.te.com/en/product-6437288-6.html
	- interpose from LVD to CEN
- AIL
	- have it be part of LVD, spend time to ensure that it is functional
	- also have volt meter as a spare
- Accumulator development
- Motors
	- Spare 228 (i think there might be already one there)
- Motor Controller
	- retrieve the one being repaired
	- order a spare in case (DX version)

### Realistic

	- change 4x 8 pin DT connectors to keyed AT connectors
	- change to opposite side of HIP
	- spec fuses properly
	- interpose from LVD to CEN
	- another double MOSFET circuit 
	- TSAL DT:
		- change naming from TSAL to UEN
		- make it an 8 pin connector
			- to route new red switched ground
- HFR
	- implement new red switching functionality 
		- 555 timer, or gate
- BSPD 
	- remove resistor voltage divider, add in pot
