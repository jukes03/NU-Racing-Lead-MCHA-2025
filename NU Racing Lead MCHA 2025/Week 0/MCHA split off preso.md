	- make sure it complies with:
		- 2025 FSAE-A rules
			- after checking rules, check the changed rules document to see if anything in there relates to the change as well
		- Technical inspection from 2024
- testing and validation
	- testing process (flesh this out)

- safety
	- to people
	- to components
	- if the tool hurts you, youre using the wrong tool
	- when wheels spin
		- make sure everything is clear
		- what needs to happen for the wheels to spin
- i am main point of contact for mcha systems and questions 
	- alec is also good, he was lead mcha last year, though it is no longer his role so all questions should go to me, and if i am not available go to him
		- break the team structure where necessary, as dylan said in the presentation
