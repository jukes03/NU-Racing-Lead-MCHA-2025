iteration of LVD on AV.One to allow for charging and DCDC enable

after that, these systems will need to be created/improved for the platform to become fully autonomous (taken from lena's report):
1. Perception Systems: Implementing LiDAR, cameras, and radar assists with obstacle detection, track recognition, and localisation. 
2. Sensor Fusion: Integrating data from multiple sensors will give accurate environment mapping and vehicle positioning. 
3. Path Planning Algorithms: Developing algorithms to create an optimal path based on track layout, obstacles, and driving conditions will create a more robust vehicle. 
4. Vehicle Control Systems: Implementing robust control algorithms studied in the Mechatronics Engineering program (eg. PID or MPC) will aid in managing throttle, braking, and steering. PID controllers are already implemented in the steering and braking code. 
5. Safety Protocols and Redundancies: continue to upgrade the safe operation of AV.One through fail-safe mechanisms and real-time error handling.
